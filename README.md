# BOOKING-APP
## The program for booking app and expected output as below

```Enter first name? Abc
Enter last name? Cde
Enter email? “test@gmail.com”
Enter number of tickets you want: 6 (we would need the total number of tickets)
Remaining tickets = Total number of tickets - number of tickets bought
```
## assumptions for program update

```
total number of tickets (CONSTANT) = 20
Associate last name with email - use map key value pair
Q. Do we want to store multiple users or single users at a time? (use loop and store it to slice)
Q. If we store only one user then just display that as output
```
